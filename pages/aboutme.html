    <h4 class="flexbox2" id="aboutbox">My name is Riley Nelson. I am an avid coder and have a passion for many different things in life. I am involved in Football and Marching Band in the fall season, and throw shot put and discus in the Spring. I love to learn and am especially interested in the computer science field. I plan on attending a four year college, specifically the University of Minnesota, to pursue a degree in Computer Science or a related field. Being involved in so many different activities and taking rigorous courses in high school has challenged me to grow as a scholar, athlete, and a person in developing time management, organisation, and teamwork skills. I wonâ€™t stop at anything to figure out a problem, finish a rep, or overcome any obstacle put in my path.
