        <h4 class="box"> This page is dedicated to projects I have made throughout my second year of coding adventures. My first project is a collage made through the Gimp image editing software that shows a few pictures of my fall activities. Most of my time spent from July-October is spent either at marching band or football, so this collage is a hat tip to my hard work. More projects and their struggles to come.

        <h4>Lightning was tough with tracking the lightning to the mouse. There are x and y coordinates of the mouse, but the base lightning works in a straight line. I had to make the hand move along with the mouse so that the lightning would be able to travel with the saber. The saber and yoda are simply images that follow the x and y coordinates of the mouse. There were also some issues with the automated moving of the mouse. Sometimes the lightning disappears because there isn't enough theoretical room for the lightning towards the bottom. Certain parameter issues also arose with the movement, yoda going off the screen and stopping entirely. </h4>
        <h4>Dice was difficult because there were many different objects to keep track of throughout the project. The shapes are a polygon method called depending on what the roll of each dice was. A shape is drawn with the same number of sides as the rolled value. The javascript part of dice was also complicated because there were many small changes that had to be made with variables and number truncation. "This." was especially annoying. </h4>
