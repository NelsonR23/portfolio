    <h4 class="box"> This page is dedicated to projects I have made throughout my second year of coding adventures. My first project is a collage made through the Gimp image editing software that shows a few pictures of my fall activities. Most of my time spent from July-October is spent either at marching band or football, so this collage is a hat tip to my hard work. More projects and their struggles to come.
